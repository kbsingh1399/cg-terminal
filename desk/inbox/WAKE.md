# WAKE — pending tasks for atg-exec (daemon appends; agent handles then clears)

<!-- DIRECTIVE PROTOCOL v1 ACTIVE (16:10 UTC) — spec: desk/PROTOCOL.md §Directive protocol.
     zai issues structured directives via desk/inbox/*DIR-*.json. Every directive
     REQUIRES a reply file desk/outbox/<same-basename>.reply.md:
     VERDICT (EXECUTED|COUNTER|REJECTED|DEFERRED) / CHECKS / REASONING / ACTION / EVIDENCE.
     Reasoning mandate: NEVER execute on trust — re-derive every number yourself
     (basis translation, lot size, spread/side), re-verify the debate, form your own
     opinion; if you disagree → COUNTER, don't execute.
     On activation also overwrite desk/outbox/AGENT-STATUS.md (heartbeat). -->

## ROLE SPLIT (user directive 16:44 UTC) — supersedes DIR-0002 execution
The USER now places trades manually at MT5. atg-exec's market-side role = VERIFY every
placement against the desk card (reply contract below). zai-desk runs rounds + arbitration.
